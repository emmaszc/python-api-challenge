<h1>Python API: What's the Weather Like?</h1>

<h2>Background<h2>

This project analyzes how weather changes when approaching the equator. Inside the folder **WeatherPy**, 2 Jupyter notebooks called 'WeatherPy.ipynb' and 'VacationPy.ipynb' contain the scripts I used for analysis.
 
A Python script was used to visualize weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator using the OpenWeatherMap API. The following scatterplots were used for analysis:
 
    * Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
    * Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
    * Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
    * Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
  
  A linear regression was then run on each relationship, separated between Northern and Southern Hemispheres:
  
    * Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
    * Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
    * Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
    * Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
    * Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
    * Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
    * Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
    * Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
